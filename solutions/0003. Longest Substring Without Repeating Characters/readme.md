## Problem

Given a string ```s```, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.
Â 
**Constraints:**
	
- ```0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104```
	
- ```s``` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

=== "Example 1"

    ```bash
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
    ```

=== "Example 2"

    ```bash
    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    ```

=== "Example 3"

    ```bash
    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
    ```

**Complexity:**

* Time complexity : O(n).
* Space complexity : O(n).
